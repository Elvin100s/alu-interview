# Minimum Operations

This project contains a solution to the "Minimum Operations" interview problem.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
- All files end with a new line
- The first line of all files is exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file is present at the root of the project
- Code is documented and follows PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All files are executable

## Problem Description

In a text file, there is a single character `H`. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: **Copy All** and **Paste**.  
Given a number `n`, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` `H` characters in the file.

- Prototype: `def minOperations(n)`
- Returns an integer
- If `n` is impossible to achieve, return `0`

### Example

For `n = 9`:
